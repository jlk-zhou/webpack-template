# webpack-template
This repository contains sample webpack configuration. It can be used to create webpack projects conveniently. 

## Usage
First, build your website using what you have in the ./src directory. 

To view in real time what you have built, run "npm run start" and a browser window should pop up with what you have built. 

To compile the website for production, run "npm run build" and generate production files located in a new ./dist directory.
